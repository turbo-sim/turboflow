## Quick Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of installing `Turboflow` via `pip`. To isolate the Turboflow installation and avoid conflicts with other Python packages, it is recommended to create a dedicated Conda virtual environment.

1. [Install Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/) if you don't have it already.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and create a new virtual environment named `turboflow_env` with Python 3.11:
   ```
   conda create --name turboflow_env python=3.11
   ```

3. Activate the newly created virtual environment:
   ```
   conda activate turboflow_env
   ```

4. Install Turboflow using pip within the activated virtual environment:
   ```
   pip install turboflow
   ```

5. Verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   python -c "import turboflow; turboflow.print_package_info()"
   ```

   If the installation was successful, you should see the Turboflow banner and package information displayed in the console output.

Congratulations! You have now successfully installed Turboflow in its own Conda virtual environment using pip. You're ready to start using Turboflow in your Python projects.
