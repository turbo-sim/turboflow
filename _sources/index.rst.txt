Overview
========

TurboFlow is a Python package for mean-line modelling of axial turbines. It aims to offer flexible and reliable simulations for both performance prediction and design optimization, 
and should present a valuable resource for engineers and researchers working in the field of turbomachinery.

Features
========

- **Performance Prediction:** Accurately predict the performance of axial turbines based on various input parameters.
- **Design Optimization:** Optimize preliminary axial turbine design to achieve optimal performance metrics.
- **Equation-oriented problem formulation:** Equation-oriented problem formulation for performance analysis and design optimization.
- **Model consitency:** The model is consistent for both performance prediction and design optimization.
- **Efficient solution:** The model adopts gradient-based root-finding and optimization solver.
- **Real gas fluid property analysis:** CoolProp is used to determine thermohpysical properties.
