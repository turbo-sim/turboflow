	doi = {10.17863/CAM.106741},
	abstract = {Estimates of turbomachinery performance trends inform system-level compromises during preliminary design. Existing empirical correlations for efficiency use limited experimental data, while analytical loss models require calibration to yield predictive results. From a set of 3708 radial compressor computations, this paper maps efficiency as a function of mean-line aerodynamics, and determines the governing loss mechanisms. An open-source turbomachinery design code creates annulus and blade geometry, then runs a Reynolds-average Navier–Stokes simulation for compressors sampled from the mean-line design space. Polynomial surface fits yield a continuous eight-dimensional representation of the design space for analysis, predicting efficiency with a root-mean-square error of 1.2\% points.},
